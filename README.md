The **KDD Cup 2009** dataset has three variables, namely, **Churn**, **Appetency** and **Upselling**, upon which the predictions and inferences can be made. <br>
   Among these response variables, our team intends to predict the class of Churn data. Here, we build models to predict if an individual becomes a part of the business or not when given certain features about the business or(and) about the individual. Further, we analyze how well our models perform based on known metrics.
